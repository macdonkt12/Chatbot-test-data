Team questions to counter 
Lean 
1. Eliminates jobs - rpm biases tasks, and forces you to learn and grow faster , only eliminates job if the ONLY value you provide to the company was whatever task was just automated, If you automate what you don't like you can focus on an area of the business that's more interesting to you
2. Seems like more work - yeah like setting up a pulley system is more work than pushi mg a thousand lb block 
2b. Want to do this extra work for Josh
You're not doing this extra work for Josh you're doing this extra work for you Josh doesn't pay you the company does the company is the collective if everyone leaves tomorrow Josh doesn't make millions in revenue

Improve quality of life of our customers
Grow ppl 


Lean doesn't necessarily mean make the part faster 
It's means doing it with less struggle less waste 
So you do produce the kart faster but not because you're moving faster or putting more effort into it 
It's actually that you've removed obstacles so you have higher leverage 
A.k.a. more output for the same input


Fix what bugs you 
Make your life easier
Standardized work and continuous improvement (pool example, drive to work example - you already do this is your daily life, lean is just about applying it more intentionally at work) 

Job is to help provide proof lean and no code automation is the answer 
Provide mental frameworks to solve problems , physical and digital tools

Thoughts/ additional ways to sell future ore fellows and anyone else ha 

You can  go to Silicon Valley and get BIG idea visionary thinking BUT you’ll suffer from the inherently bloated operational complexity,  inefficiencies and stressful timelines that funding and venture capital inevitably cause

Alternatively you can go to a Fastcap-like hyper lean company with amazing operational excellence BUT they lack the understanding of advanced software and broader business opportunity landscape 

OR 

You can come to the middle of Indiana and get BIG visionary thinking leveraging software and running lean with operational excellence that removes the struggle, makes working a joy and provides you the bandwidth to continue thinking BIGGER and BIGGER

Starting at 
@1:10:30

The game you're playing is not success 
The game you are playing is not money 
The game that you're playing is brain chemistry 
It's about fulfillment 
The only ultimately that's ever going to matter in your life 
Is how you feel about yourself when you're by yourself 
The things you say quietly to yourself in your own mind when no one else is around 
That's what matters 
And becoming somebody that you're proud of 
In whatever way you define that 
Is completely open to you 
Humans are the ultimate adaptation machine 
We can grow in any direction
It's what we are designed to do 


How
By leveraging the only belief that matters
Action follows belief - but what if you don't believe in yourself what if you're actually not good enough..yet 

Well 
If you believe that
If you out time an energy into a thing you will get better at it 

Then you're good 

On a long enough time line 
It will work 
You will win 



If you don't like who you are today, that's ok 
It doesn't matter who you are today 
It's only matters who you want to become and pride you're willing to pay to get there

The most fun you're ever going to have 
The pinnacle of existence 
Is that moment where you're working really hard at something that could pay off tremendously and you believe it's going to work 
There's nothing better than that moment 

Oh my god I'm working really hard at this, I think it's gonna work, and if it works the world is gonna be mine
That's Way more fun than winning, and actually getting the thing 
So enjoying that ride, that's the juice

THE LEARNER 

willingness to listen to content and teach others 
cradle of coaches 

I think one of the primary things we ingrain in Aruba is the willingness to listen to content. Everyone doesn’t have to listen to as much as us, but they have to listen to 2 books a month, one podcast a week? Idk something we agree on as a team is reasonable starting point and then build from there (having these peoples voices in our heads is, in my opinion ONE if not THE primary reason we have “irrational optimism” and can reset and keep going. Every time you learn something new or re learn something old it gives you hope again. And your brain says well, THIS time it will be different. And even if it’s not, you have to keep thinking that until it is!

China big melter 
China mini pouring (electro magnetic?) 
American desktop melter (to start right now and do one off candles) 
Heat tunnel 
Heat guns 
Wick centering 
Scales 
Vacuum conveying etc etc 
Utility sink with very hot water (its own hot water heater? Turn it up higher than usual?) 

A long verison of the hand stirrer I have ? - the one I have for single candles (also perfect for the pitcher mixing the wax) 
***angling the mixer at 45 degrees and putting it near the wall prevents it from vortexing and splashing 
A single blade normal mixer 
A drill with a mixer attachment 
The actual mixer on the mini meleter 
The massive mixer on the big melter 

A HOT BOX (or old oven- for cleaning and storing tools and tubes etc ) 
With mesh basket for cleaning wick bars especially , fill hot box with racks and hooks (force fit hose "clamps" to hold hoses vertically and let them run out 
(Have to have a drain and pan under the hot box to collect wax then dispose of 


Find really good (and cheap?) sheet metal fabricators - ask Steere contacts 

Make the candle facility map and a list of EVERY single item needed and what it costs 

Utility sink with high pressure overhead kitchen washer (super hot water) 
Drain blocker to catch wax (always pour wax out in hot box or a ntp a trash can before watching so very minimal wax in sink) 

Brown Kraft paper for tables 


Process 
Weigh out the amount needed for the batch in the back, then they just slowly add all of it to the melter 
Figure out the ideal amount to add each time 
What's a good amount to start with so it melt quickly and doesn't form blocks, then what's the equation for the rate at which you increase the fills based on the total amount of melted wax in the tank (this is for when it's done by a computer ha) for people just have them add 5 pulls from the Pneu con every 5 min or something 
(You're NOT supposed to run the melter empty , you'll burn out the elements, but we should have them "pre heat it" for like 10 min or something? Nah shouldn't really matter they can just add the first pull from the pneu con then start it up ) 


Etch lines in the pouring pitcher for 1 candle 2 3 4 5 etc (aka lines every 190 grams) 



Use the sensor push temp and humidity sensor
And set up "Optera" just wyze or ring security cams and record the tops of the candles. 
If o see cracks form I will be able to know the exact ambient temp and humidity when that happened 

I can get a thermocouple and do the same thing do the inside of the candle 


Pitcher with sharper pouring nozzle - for more accuracy and less spill 


Fume hood from Bob!!!

Practical scientific thinking and accurate thought 


People only get mad about corrections when 
They're insecure 
They don't actually care about the activity their performing 

If you're a basketball player and lebron James offered you tips are you gonna get mad? Or are you going to intently and curiously listen and apply what he says 

I'm not comparing myself to lebron James 
But im one step or at least half a step ahead of most people in this organization in terms  of manufacturing process optimization 

Driven by the moment of awakening 
Wait, I can learn new things 
Just cuz I'm Not good today doesn't mean I can't be good tomorrow 



# 2 
Keep 8in wicks - easy to grab and hold while cutting so you can throw in trash bin and not on floor or table 

Spring loaded wire cutters - non bull nose are actually better , because it's easier and faster to approach the cut and don't have to avoid the wick and can hold on to the wick without pushing it to the side 


Need a medium brittle brush for getting wax out of threads 

Micro fiber towels and coveralls from that uniform shop that washes them 




# 4
A flexible adaptable business has to be a true learning organization with "respect for people" at its core. Automation must always supplement people, not replace them. If it replaces them in a certain task, it just means we need to upskill them to the next higher leverage task.  The only way we succeed long term is if we embed learning and education and creating scientific problem solving  leaders into our culture. Like GE and Amazon are similar in that one of their major competence advantages is creating leaders. Unless we are capable of creating people who better at process than me and better at vision and leadership than you, we will only make it so far. 
We have to build a team and leaders who can grow the business without either one of us because as we get bigger and bigger we would transition into true owners (even if I don't have equity it's just how I think and act I'm not trying to encroach on your actual compete ownership ha) and be resource allocators and high performance sports team recruiters.


In summary form my current perspective our important and differentiating competitive advantages will be 
1. Capitalizing on tourist town opportunities other don't see. And doing it quietly and what appears to be lots of individual unique brands, not as a franchise. (Brands within our product hedgehog concept of filling cylinders or rectangular jars with hot or cold liquid or granulated dry good and labeling it) 
2. Operational modularity, flexibility and SIMPLICITY!A commitment to quality through speed. 
3. A cradle of coaches. We build leaders better than google and Amazon and GE. Even if you HATE our product mix, you want to work with us because we're the best way to learn commerce leadership. People don't care about getting into Harvard, they care about being accepted into our rotational program.

Future vision 

1. I forgot I have the IP licensing rights to a project called MerryModz through one of the NFTs I own. If it does well this holiday season we could just print labels with the designs and put it on our products next year for holiday season. 

2. My 2nd cousin or something I forget his exact relation to me ha But he owns CaptiveAire. The company that does fume hoods for places like chipotle chick filet etc. (useful as the other day I was thinking I need a fume hood to pull out some of the candle fumes so our people don't pass out ha and or contaminate the scent of products being made around it. Allowing us to compress our footprint even further. Also useful slash relevant for any of your food/ restaurant concepts.

metrics 

Profit per employee / throughput per employee ratio 

% increase in AOV for a given account on a give seasonal project compared to last year. As a ratio to the incremental increase of LTV of the overall account compared to the last 12 months. (Or keep it constrained to the same last year duration instead of the rolling 12 months?) 

What I actually me in the  LTV is take the LTV for a rolling last 12 months and compare take the delay between that and the 12 months prior to that 12 month period  

Can't think a account way to say that ha 


Use the AOV/LTV metric as the true single  North Star metric for the business 
And then as the primary acquisition metric 
Then the primary fulfillment metric is the profit per employee as a ratio to throughput per employee. 

OR better yet profit per employee as a ratio to improvements per employee. How many times they posted a genuinely useful before/after video. Their manager will review every video and add them to the scorecard to n monthly and quarterly meetings with them.  

(essentially the north star metric of the fulfillment org , but we will only use north star metric for the truly singular business metric which should always deal with acquisition leads profit metrics)

We are building a team of researchers (Aka good at googling slash asking questions like your describing) systems thinking first principal problem solvers, and process engineers.

We'd need 1 maybe 2 workers in the candle section to wick and transfer trays, and fill and mix was and fragrance. (but soon after I already have ideas for automating the wicking and tray transfer. The wax and fragrance mixing obviously could be done but i thin it add unnecessary complexity to what can very easily be done by a human for a while) 




- 500 liters melter (we had a water jacket version, maybe also investigate the electromagnetic version here as well) 
- Mini pouring machine (they have water jacket version we had, and also electromagnetic versions (i think my preference is elctormagnetic, which was the same heating method for our biggest melter) We also want the mixer with motor for this one.

Another version of water jacket mini pour
(not in the picture- but in the video I like that SPECIFIC handle layout) 
I also like that it uses a dual pump head

I should ask them to make a vertical version of that handle (do they have a three pump version) 
2 pump version
https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Dongguan-Yide-Desktop-Depilatory-Wax-Heating_1600115595417.html
(Could just do two sets of double pumps next to each other routed to a mutual junction...BUT then the plc's will be different, adds unnecessary and very annoying complication) 

If they put a circular metal plate on the side I could have the robot use the electro magnetic end effector to grab onto it 
https://onrobot.com/us/products/mg10


If they connected the 3 pump version (if it exists) into a vertical format  with all of them connected together. AKA a 6 nozzle pouring head. 
Then put a circular metal plate on the top of it (aka the flat plane of the circle would be parallel with the "flat plane" that is the opening of the nozzles
Vertical loading would be the best for the robot arm

(Ask what the length of the hoses is, ask what is the most we could increase hose length before having significant effect on the pump throughput - dont accept theory, have them test longer hose lengths into measure cups and send videos) 


(HAVE A NAMING COMPETITION TO NAME THE CANDLE ROBOT) 
The winner gets lunch and a free box of candles or something ha 

(JUST HAVE TO double check weight, planning on UR 10, but we could always upgrade to the UR16 if needed, or the UR 20, which might actually be necessary for tray transfer into bun racks.
(NEED TO WEIGH A FULL TRAY OF CANDLES) 

ALSO need
How many total candles (trays of candles) fit into a bun rack

(TAKE several boxes of Candles down with me on Monday. Fill up a tray test fit and weigh) 



With 3 cobots I think I could automate the whole damn thing 
And they can be progressive in size to save money 
1. URe5 to wick jars 
2. URe10 to pour candles
3. URe20 with fork attachment to load trays into bun racks 

Conveyor section from wicking (humans would have to insert wick bar) 
To accumulator 
Humans stack jars onto a tray 
Conveyor section moves trays into position for in station pouring
Conveyor section moves tray out of station 
To be picked up by cobot to place in bun racks 
(After x nunber of trays, cobot also stops so human can line up a new bun rack tray- OR better the robot could probably access two bun racks. After it finishes one bun rack a light goes on, the human monitor sees it and goes and replaces that rack. So the robot can continue to operate uninterrupted) 


So updated form list above to fully automate I would need 
4 cobots (2 UR5s, 1 UR10, 1 UR20 )
One accumulator 
3 conveyor sections 

Wicking 
Have humans load what would look essentially like a giant revolver barrel with wick tabbed wicks (barrels they would be loading them into are mildy magnetic so wick stays in place) 
The robot picks them and flips them over (again wick stays in place because of magnets) 
Then it uses vision to scan jar and place wick in the center 


(Add the paper notes verisona of mixing fragrance oil and wax also - and matching timers up etc )

Candle process 
3 mini pouring machines - 1 active use, 1 on deck , 1 being filled for replenishment 

1. Weigh fragrance in a pot sitting on a scale (scale will be double check because fill lines will be etched in pot for standard batch size)

2. Fill 60l tank from 500 liter melter sitting on the electromagnetic cart
(Can integrate a scale or ask them to integrate a load cell) 
Scale will be a double check really because we will do the same batch size each time, and will etch marks into the steel to denote where to fill to (for easy visual instructions) 

(If need to do a smaller batch could just fill it on a separate cart with a scale and lift it onto pouring cart - just dont want to do that transfer with full 60L containers because its very heavy and easy to spill) 


***have them cut a hole in the lids for the mini pouring pots 
Put a rubber cone gasket that you can push the pickup tube down through and not let heat out, when you pull it out, because its a cone it will act as wipers to wipe excess wax off the tube 
(Make them build it so this is an easily replaceable wear part 



***filling with robots
Pump heads have a timer 
Robots have timers 
it could easily pour six candles across 

Figure out what signal technology their remote uses for the pump head 
Then tie that into the part detect and have it pause the pump until the part detect is made (use Vention machine motion as the controller system) 
Same for the robot 

So both the robot and the robot timers are started based on part detect made 
(Build in a containing spill tray in case they will get off...they will get off, this is a rough ideas but I'm sure I'm missing things, will have to test 

Manually pour and determine how many trays one barrel can pour before it gets low and the pump is in danger of dry running 
Have the robot count how many trays have been done and then pause the pump or cut power to it, pause itself and trigger an Andon light 
then the human attendant comes over and switches the pump lines into the on deck pumping pot. (They would also pour the remnants of the current tank into a pot to pour 1-2 candles....SLASH if they are continuing production could just pour it into the top of the next pot...but when on last pot, have to make sure that wax is used to hand pour and not wasted )


Process steps high level
1. Fill wax pot sitting on pouring cart
2. Fill fragrance pot 
3. Manually pouring fragrance pot into wax pot
4. use a hand drill with mixer attachment to mix 
5. Roll into position and insert the pickup lines

500L (500,000g) is 2500 candles 
30,000/2500 = 12 tanks 
Assume min 2 tanks per day 
30,000 candles in  6 days 

500L x 12 = 6000L 
6000/60 = 100 mini tanks in 6 days 

1000 L per day is 
1000/60 = 16.67 mini tanks per day 

1000L x 1000g= 1,000,000g 
Which is

Their just more confident in the action, and even then it's that they're confident that acting is better cannot  acting

Then as people do them, they add them as individual task lines in airtable. ESPECIALLY if there is output involved.

Is it number of SOPs made - partially? But really a better number is probably number of revisions of the core 4 SOPs. Thats a good input metric which is controllable. The output metric you are trying to effect is, numbers of boxes shipped per week/day/hour. Internal NPS score. Feedback loop. How well do you understand you job. Has your job gotten easier is the past month? DO you have ideas for how to make your job easier that have not been considered and addressed?

Anyway, to use a slight teaching moment ha most of management is 
1. Making people feel seen heard recognized (by superiors and peers) 
2. Involving them in the building of everything. Ask questions to guide them to what you are pretty sure are the answers so the ideas feel like theirs not yours
3. Make sure you are positioning the task such that it aligns their incentives with your incentives 

Now you can skip reading about 40 books on management hahah

peak performance

This comes form my own pespretcife on life many other places I've heard similar things and reinforced in this podcast 

3 phase 
- Scientific method - learn how to peers and make progress in any area , picking which general heroes journey path you want to go down 
- Heroes journey - deeper than what do you do, who are you
- Artists journey 

You're in phase 1 
You have no idea what your doing, you think you have everything under control and then you end up completely fucking it up, nothing seems to be going your way and you are often nervous confused and generally unaware of what direction your life is headed...
This is all 100% normal and as it should be, regardless of other people may tell you ha 
Those same people telling you something different also did incredibly dumb shit and ducked things yo when they were younger...yes including your parents, they are waaaaaaaay less perfect and certain about things than they appear ha . It's a very useful dilusionnto have as a kid but it's like when you were younger and you realize Santa's not real, you probably kind of understand what I'm saying, but there will be a time when you KNOW it, for me it was somewhere around 27-28 when I KNEW (not just intellect lually understood my parents were just as broken if not more so as me) It's a weird feeling but an important one to realize as you mature.

Success is define by the number of experiments you can fit in 24hrs 

Identity transformation - to what extent are you patient etc 

Stop trying to make the "right" call 
Just pick the general direction you like more 
When you've got it down to two...just ducking pick one (but what if...just pick one ) 



Do what your goal demands 

Do you have to get yourself to where 
The thing that you want to do the doing of it is enjoyable

**5 row (max) candle tray **
40 candles 
38lbs 

Tray weight 
3lbs 

Single candle 
397 grams (.875lbs) 


**4 rows candle rack **
32 candles 

31lbs 

(.875x32) + 3 = 31 (cool ok consistent) 



**3 row candle rack **
24 candles 

24 lbs total 

.875x24 + 3 = 24 (double check works) 


**Bun rack**
10 trays of 32 candles = 320 candles per rack 


2500/320 = 7.8 
So 8 racks 

So 5000 candles is 16 racks 

10000 candles is 32 racks 


1. 
So if we start at 2500 candles every 2 days it's 
37,500 candles per month 


2. 
Quickly jump to 5k candles poured per day (then process them) 
So 5k candles per 2 days 

So 75k candles per month 


3. 
Go big at 10k candles every 2 days 
150,000 candles per month 


So based on scenario 2(my true target) 
We'd need 10,000 wick bars 
5k for poured candles that are being processed on day 2 
5k for new candles being poured 


10,000 at .45 cents is $4500 
(Make sure Josh knows these are designed per jar, so these are only for 8oz glass candles jars) 



500L tank is 2500 candles 

60L pouring drums 
60,000/ 190 = 7.9 

Or 500/60 = 8.33 
(it's more because 500L can actually do 2600 candles but for ease of batch sizes I just made it 2500)

Quotes - culture 
The reality is merely an allusion albeit a very persistent one.
Albert Einstein 

The first principle is that you must not for yourself, and you are the easiest to fool
Richard Feynman 

Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it's time to pause and reflect.
Mark twain.

Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.
Oscar Wilde 

Actions may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action
Benjamin Israeli 

Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition that I feared?”
Seneca 

Most things just aren't as serious as you make them out to be
Tim Ferriss 

I'm an old man and have known many troubles but most of them never happened
Mark twain

A persons success in life can usually be measured by the number of months, comfortable conversations you're willing to have 
Tim Ferriss quoting something he heard 

If you are insecure, guess, what the rest of the world is too
Do not overestimate the competition and underestimate yourself.
You are better than you think.
Tim Ferriss

*** add points for joshes hand written picture notes he sent me on todays date (12/17/22) 

Every company is a hospitality company 
Every company is an education/coaching company 

Respect for people 

Growing leaders who live our values 

Every leader is a teacher developing the next generation of leaders 

The irony is Respect for people requires that people feel the pain of critical feedback 
If we do not give people accurate feedback based on real Behavior , they are not growing, and we are not respecting them 

Put them in challenging positions where they just work hard to succeed and still see how it could have been even better 

"i can not be your mentor without sometimes being your tormentor" 


Grow people 
Improve quality of life of customers 

Fix what bugs you 
Create flow 
Wherever we ask the question that's where the answer should be 



Narrative 
They move followed their own playbook to a tee 

Year 1 - perfect operations 
Year 2- duplicate in 2-3 locations , and open corresponding retail locations 
Year 3- begin forray into hospitality

C- given detailed instructions, they show up on time, they get the job done on time, the produce high quality quality work, and they're helpful to those around them but not necessarily teaching a lot, high level individual contributors, but they work 9-5, when they clock out, they have other priorities in life and they dont think about work at all

Review game tape - any missing tools / parts and tie wins or fails to core values decision making 
Global tags organization talks about your tasks from yesterday and what OUTPUTS should be linked into DCC 
(can request office hours organization session)


Work management airtable - transparency and accountability 
(also drafts/ google docs and workflowy) 

But for public consumption - airtable 
Record and TAG each of your tasks you actually do (even if it wasn't in in the morning, if you do something else, record it) 
gives you a chronological view of what you've done 

If it has input or output files, PASTE them in the output folder
And then create a shared link to the DCC workflowy

I continue to build it a database of knowledge and issac and I connect it to our actual database  and we let our people query it for data (we would have to put some controls in place so people can't ask detailed financial results ha or people's salaries etc ) 

But we could use chat gpt and the natural language to sql function to slide and dice our own data in strategy meetings 

Combine this with power bi!! 

Holy shit this is going to be unreal

Put it all together for manufacturing and shipping morning meetings with me recording Spanish audio for them to listen to before the meeting, as well as 5 min Lean concept for the day (building on details of the lean concept for the week) - which we then cycle through based on spaced repetition time intervals 

(Meeting you control the language - if you ask me a question in Spanish I’ll do my best to respond in Spanish/ Spanglish , and if you ask me a question in English I’ll reply in English) 

Before that meeting have a 10 min morning meeting with Orr fellows Amanda and Ian 
(Everyone writes down the 3 things they have to do for the day - now I won’t be checking in everyday to see if you’ve done them, this is just for all of us to be clear with our own direction hold ourselves publicly accountable and ask for advice from the team if we feel unclear on our top 3 priorities for the day )

Steven wolfram on how simple is better

 For me, there was also a third motivating idea—that came from my work on A New Kind of Science (NKS). One might have thought that to perform any kind of complex task would always require a complex program. But what I learned in A New Kind of Science is that simple programs can often do highly complex things.

But our core values has to be reduced to 3 (suggested as split) 

- Data accuracy 
- 4th grade communication (how to make a PB&J) 
- High Say/Do ratio (trust, integrity) 

- Good (extreme ownership - aka accountability) 
- Master padawan/ cradle of coaches (aka the identity of a learner, always in willing to be a beginner, Make others successful by sharing knowledge and teaching and training others with the genuine goal and desire for them to outshine you!) 
- Fender benders (culture of experimentation)
- Fuc# my rights (not easily offended, do and believe that which moves you towards you goals) 
- You're/it's not good enough...yet (the only belief that matters, but f you out time and energy into something with intentional and deliberate practice, you will get better. Struve for excellence in everything you do. Don't worry about winning a championship but do worry about becoming capable of a championship performance)

Education 

You will only perform as well as work as the person that you are 

Will duh Kevin but just think about it for a second

First of all people think there's these two lies that you lied there's work in this personal nope they're just living 


And if you're more disciplined and organized at work than at home which most people are, I think that actually a bad thing

Most people serve proud of that.
New line.

But what that means is every day I have to use up energy use willpower use focus to change who you are to behave differently for eight hours and then when you go home, you immediately revert in the back into who you are .

So actually the easier thing to do well harder short term easier long-term is to actually change who you are.

So that personal you is the same as business you because it's just you living your life

You've heard and it's more true than people think it is that the way you do one things the way you do everything

And you can never truly be a high performer. If you are not a high performer, you can pretend to be on it work and then be a slob at home real high performers will outperform you that's making you not high-performance because they are doing it all the time and you're faking it




My role 
Ever meeting is a national televised speech 
My ratings from you 
Do you feel like you could run through a brick wall - grey meeting 
Do you feel at lhome ast a little better after than befor the meeting - good meeting 
Do you feel more anxious confused or generally worse after the meeting - shit meeting 

Anonymous or named feedback - you choose 
And whether it not you want to talk about it 


 

Recommend Tony free challenge 
Do a personality test 


Everything is an experiment

FILM OR AT LEAST AUDIO RECORD ALL OF THIS 


Morning meeting 
Having others run the meeting 


I don't want to go too into the personal dev side here now 
But that's the key 

As we have 1on1 meetings we'll dive deep
Not because I'm smarter or better or don't fail 
I do all the things warping that everyone else does 
But I have gotten better at recovering more quickly from my mistakes 
And I'm willing to listen to people tell me I suck at aowmthing I think I'm good at 
And then adoating not just my mindset but my behavior 

(Use you not I) 

Scalable meetingbstuff to guide a simpler conversation 
Replicate before iterate 


Vice people print out and Murf.ai audio of 
6 oh narrative and 4 bullets WorkFlowy 

Then start with 6 of narrative 
And then personality test 

Then let scalable meeting guide 



This presentation will probably my suck 
But it will be a meta verison of what inhibe to teach 
With is de looking the habit of scientific thinking 
Because then you can improve anything anytime anywhere 
It's the only way to profess in life is you ah e any kind of goal or achievement you want to hit 
I'd problem 
Form hypothesis 
Chose a success metric and run experiment 
Analyze results - you will succeed a certain percentage and Fisk a certain percentage 
Adjust experiment and run again 

If you want to be a beach bum and have no achievement at all you don't need this 

For literally anything else 
This is the process you are running 
When I micro .4 scone verison subconsciously  or  a macro very intentional 10 years strategy you iterate  in 

All of that to say that's why you have print outs and digital copies (you only digital verison so just for you unless you want to share it ) 
Of all preenetagion materials 
Bc ideal at the end of this during our 1on1s you say 
Hey I liked there's 3 things you did 
But here's theb27 things I think you did poorly 
Because that what I will do with you and so then bviosuky you should do the same with me 

There a quote I love from Ted lasso (if you haven't watched it we're goin to watch the first few episodes in the evening for anyone who wants to join) 

I cannot be your mentor without occaisoonly being your tormentor 
So there is a literal printed contact you'll see on the last page to that effect 
Don't sign it unless you mean it 
Andnif you don't only you and I will know and we can discuss in one n ones 
It's obviously not legally binding in anyway 
But it is an important symbolic gesture 

I spent a lot of time of this 
And I might fall flat on face and I want you to tell me if I do 
Because again it shows what I hope to teach 
And if I expect it of you I better expect it of myself 

Couple of disclaimers 
This presentation might suck - I don't know you well enough or have thought through this enough although I did spend a lot of time doing it to make it great 
Because thinking only gets you so far 
Iteration is what makes greatness 
So by default the first time I lean this team in a meeting it probably won't be very good 
And the difference between here and most places is 
I want you to tell me 
And my commitment to you is I will actually listen and actually make not only mentían changes but behavioral changes taking real action in the real world on what you tell me 
Because that's what I expect from all of you 

Now this is like when your in the exit aisle on a plane  I need yea confirmation from each one of you 
Issac Amanda gersrd JM Ian Josh Jen George 

Disclaimer two - relates to one 
Some of you are probably already thinking 
Great is this just gonna be 3 days of the new guy lecturing us on how to runout business 
No but also yes depending perspective 

Nothing i say at anytime should be stake as a lecture 
If it sounds like one tell me because is unitentional 
80% of the time when I'm coaching or teaching someone something and it feels like I'm being more intense than the situation calls for  
It's probably because mistake or a charger trait or belief I struggled with in the past or am
Still fighting 
So often my advice is more to myself than anyone else 

So all of that to say please do not take anything I say as a lecture 
It's not because I think I'm better than anyone else or that I don't make the same mistakes

I fuck up ⬆️n all the same ways as everybody else 
What I pride myself on is simply recovering from those failures faster 
And that's what I hope we can all learn together 



From there go into communication framework 
Start with problem frame solution visualize success (mention 6 of narrative they listens to and read - encourage edits and iterations to that, to help have a real story of what we're going towards, right now it's going to be skewed in my perspective , and I'll keep rewriting my own verison and Id encourage you to do the same, but then in the company verison we come to an agreement 

For each doc 
6 of narrative 
4 bueller points 
DCC when we make it 
Etc 

Keep your own verison 
Iterate on  it  
That will help you add more value and iterate on the company verison when we come together to discuss 


We are not implanting a flavor of the month management practice 

Lean is not a tool to implemented
It is a way of thinking to be developed 

In the same we are striving to build a culture that mimics 
A high performance sports team 

And that's doesn't happen over nights
That develops over months and years 

Because
1 we have big goals 
2 it's ducking fun to be a member of a championship team 

However 
Don't necessarily worry about wining a championship ring 
But worry a lot about becoming capable of a championship performance 

Along the same lines we have to make sure that we design a game that is still fun 
Even when we're losing 

Because when you have a great team and that camaraderie will ts just ducking fun 

I can remember in middle school my baseball team we were second to last in the league 
But it was so much fun because the coach who happened to be my dad créete an environment where people felt safe to keep trying even when they weren't pickingnitnuobas fast as other people

We're putting people into roles where their nature is beneficial 


What are the strengths and weaknesses of the team?
Who is going to be good? If like, how do you put people in positions where they're going to excel?



I like coaching and teaching entrepreneurial manufacturing startups 
I pride myself on wanting to become good at it   It the real pride comes form being able to have someone say, hey you know that thing you think your hood at, you actually suck at it because of x y z 

Then going and crying in a corner and then comiendo back the next day and working on xyz


Helping people move forward and take action 
Detach and get outside their own heads 
See the bigger picture 

Get out of your head into your body 

It's only a problem in your eco system 
Step outside of that and no one including you ahítos care 


As an achiever and problem solver - you think evey problem can and should be solved 

Sometimes it's a dichotomy to be managed 

Or just something to detach from 


Don't get wrapped up in the gun fight happening in front of your face 


You wanna detach...shut your mouth

Its accountability and transparency not to make with hunts and whose fault is it easier, bc we won't be doing that 

Its accountability to enable out teammates to help nudge us back onto the right path 

We want to feel good about what value we've added and feel accomplished and good about ourselves at the end of the day 

And working in isolation in a bubble makes that impossible 

Accountability is uncomfortable
You will, I will, we will all show up to meetings without the stuff done wed said we d get done 

But again, its no about did you fail did you fuck it up 
Its, are you getting better over time 
Right like you'll have dips, its not up and to the right all the time 
But its like the stock market 
If you look daily or weekly or monthly its this jagged up and down mess 
Zoom out to a year or a decade things start to look up and to the right
